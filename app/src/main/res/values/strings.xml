    <string name="details">Hi, \n \nLooks like you have not set up the requirements. The app requires a one time setup.


        \n \nFirst off, let me promise you this app works. This app will let you send text messages to one number of your choice for free.
        But since it uses the APIs of a web service called \'Twilio\' you will need four things to set it up first: \n
        1. The number you used for registration\n
        2. The number twilio gave you \n
        3. The Account SID\n
        4. The Auth Token  \n

        \n \n
        Please make sure you copy and paste these four values correctly so that the app works.
        First off visit https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio in your favourite browser and come back with the four numbers \n
